This implies that the\ndefault version will be part of the package distribution, and must\nnot be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at\nany other time).\n.\nThis script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that\nmay not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,\nbut handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to\nmaintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general\noffering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally\nprovides for 'conffiles'.\n.\nAdditionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a\nfile that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come\nunder this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at\ninstallation time.

Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses\na previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries\nto execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from\ncron.\n.\nfrom GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate\n.\n* it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only\ninclude files that the user running locate has access to. It does\nthis by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for\nnormal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate\ndoes this as well, but not the original locate.\n.\n* instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time\nthe database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its\ndatabase and can know if the contents of a directory changed without\nreading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding\non the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.\n.\nInstalling mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to\nmlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may\nwish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,\notherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself\n(since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).\nAlso, you may wish to remove the \"locate\" package in order not to have\ntwo different database files updated regularly on your system."
